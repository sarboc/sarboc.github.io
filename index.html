      <h2>Fandor</h2>
      <p>Sara's first big project at Fandor was integrating their user data with the marketing team's email service provider. Her next big task was to upgrade the application to the latest version of Foundation (while leaving legacy support for the old version), and then developed the new guest homepage using the new version. In between, she pushed for a better GitHub process, resulting in the team using pull requests instead of committing to master, and implemented a series of small features and bug fixes.</p>
      <p>In addition to writing code, Sara was communicative with internal teams to make sure that projects were well-defined, well-scoped, and that the end result would meet the actual need. In some instances, she was able to reduce the work required to achieve the goal, and she focused on iterative change when possible. She also participated in on-call rotation, handling smaller issues such as IP bans, and escalating to appropriate team when needed.</p>

      <h2>Spell-O-Rama</h2>
      <p>There are many dictionary APIs, but none that can supply only words that are easily spellable. How do you determine which words humans can spell? You could write a complicated algorithm that would guess whether or not it would be spellable. Or you could ask people to spell the word.</p>
      <p>For this project, Sara took that latter approach. The front end is a spelling game that is surprisingly addictive. On the backend, there is an API endpoint that serves up words that have a high correct spelling percentage. Problem solved!</p>

      <p>Is your party off to a slow start? Lederfeier can help! Register your guests using their mobile numbers, and the app will send them conversation prompts via text message. You can choose what type of gathering you are hosting, as well as what rating the prompts should be.</p>
      <p>We thought the name was a (made-up) German term that means "pants party". It doesn't.</p>

      <h2>API Mashup Challenge</h2>
      <p>After being stuck trying to figure out what to build next, Sara thought it would be great if there was a site that would help decide for you. So she built it. API Mashup Challenge takes two random APIs from its database and challenges you to make an app using both of them. It also provides you with possible names for the project.</p>

      <h2>Saint Mary's College Website</h2>
      <p>When Sara joined Saint Mary’s College of California, the website redesign project was well under way.  The website was a few months from launch, the new content managements system was still in development, and people across campus had started working on their new pages.  She jumped right in and started running the training sessions, teaching more than 150 people to use the new CMS over the course of 4 months.  She also started serving on the redesign committee, and worked on a cross-department team to make sure the new CMS met the needs of content creators across campus.</p>
      <p>After the website launched, Sara continued to work on maintaining content, including the websites interactive homepage.  She also worked with departments across campus to refine their websites and improve content and design.  After turning over the bulk of training tasks to the Instructional Technology team, she continued to help CMS users troubleshoot, and helped start the on-campus users group.</p>

      <h2>Email Templates</h2>
      <p>In the Office of College Communications at Saint Mary’s College, Sara helped many departments get the word out about their events.  One of the best ways to accomplish this, of course, is through email marketing.  She assisted by coding one-off templates for special events, as well as creating reusable templates for newsletters.  In addition, she worked with staff members in different departments, making sure they knew how to reuse templates and send emails on their own.</p>

      <h2>Friends of the San Francisco Public Library</h2>
      <p>The main site for Friends of the San Francisco Public Library predated Sara’s employment there, but she worked to ensure that the content on the site was up to date.</p>
      <p>Before leaving Friends, Sara transitioned the donation forms (which were all hard-coded in VB.net) to a new online communications platform, Blackbaud NetCommunity Spark.  During the migration process, she coordinated efforts to move the entire database to a fully-hosted solution, trained staff on how to access the new fully-hosted solution and made updates to every “donate” link on the website so that they point to the new donation form.</p>

      <h2>Sara in a Nutshell</h2>
      <p>Sara got involved in the tech world when she was 15 as a Quality Assurance Analyst. She spent 2 years in high school testing insurance rating software (yawn) before moving to San Francisco to major in Sociology at the University of San Francisco.</p>
      <p>After a few years dabbling in other industries, Sara realized that software development was her true calling. She currently works as a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer, with a focus on solutions that scale, cleanup of an existing codebase, and pushing the application's test coverage to as close to 100% as possible.</p>
      <p>When not writing apps, Sara enjoys cooking and tries to spend as much time sewing as she does ripping out stitches. She also has an unreasonable love for period British dramas and has seen every film incarnation of Sense and Sensibility.</p>

      <p>Sara graduated from USF summa cum laude with minors in Media Studies and Gender and Sexuality Studies.  Her favorite moment in time at USF was teaching her Sociology professors the ins and outs of World of Warcraft, a necessity for her senior thesis on women’s gender performance in the game’s virtual world.</p>
